# GIE-Soliton v2.2 Deployment & Environment Initialization Protocol
### [SECURITY LEVEL: SOVEREIGN CLASSIFIED]

## 1. Core Environment Specifications
* **Instruction Set**: CPU must support AVX-512 for high-vorticity Nabla (∇) vector field operations.
* **Physical Lock**: The system architecture is hard-coded to `invariant_base = 5061.19`. Any deviation will result in immediate Psi index divergence.
* **Wei-Dissipation Architecture**: Initialize viscosity $\nu = 1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ as per Wei Dongyi's law to maintain soliton stability in turbulent manifolds.

## 2. Terminal Deployment (index.html)
* **API Integration**: Inject your unique Etherscan API Key into the designated field.
* **Asset Mapping**: Ensure target addresses align with your verified ERC20/BTC nodes.
* **Automated Verification**: The terminal monitors for the $9,999 signal. Upon TxID confirmation, the 188.4s Quantum Window is initiated.

## 3. Evolution Clause
> **STABILITY IS DYNAMIC. WE NEVER STOP EVOLVING.**
